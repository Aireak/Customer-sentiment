# Customer-sentiment
The project involved collecting, cleaning, and transforming customer review data to prepare it for sentiment analysis and business insights. The dataset included ratings, review texts, and timestamps. The dataset was standardized, missing values were handled, and dates were formatted correctly.

Key feature engineering steps included:
	•	cleaned_review (processed text for analysis)
	•	word_count and char_count (text length indicators)
	•	sentiment_category (classifying reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative)
	•	normalized_rating (scaled ratings for consistency)

Data integrity was ensured by removing duplicates and checking for missing values. Ethical considerations focused on bias mitigation and data privacy. Finally, visualizations provided insights into sentiment distribution and rating trends, making the data ready for advanced analytics.
